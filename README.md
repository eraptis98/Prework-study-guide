# < Prework Study Guide >

## Description

I made this study guide because, I am eager to learn how to become a Web developer. By creating this study guide, I get to increase my knowledge of coding by learning and honing in on my skills. 
This project solves the issue of not knowing how to use tools such as Visual Code Studio, Chrome Dev Tools and Github applications. Along with solving these things, it also helped with building knowledge on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the importance of building a properly structured README file, all while being a place to store my notes. 
By doing all of this I learned the importance of taking my time, as a simple error such as a missing period can affect the whole project. 
This can be done by making sure the branch currently displayed matches the one needed for changes and remembering to update the local copy as you go. You can also use short cuts such as the up and down arrow keys to avoid spelling errors, when using repeat commands. 
All of these things insure that the project will go smoothly if and when bugs shall appear.
